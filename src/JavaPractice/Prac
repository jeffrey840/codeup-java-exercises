# Extra Array Exercises

1. Create a command line grocery list maker

    - before prompting the user to enter each item, ask how many items will be
      entered
    - for each item, the user should be prompted to enter in the name, quantity,
      and category of each grocery item
    - Create a `GroceryItem` class from which to instantiate `GroceryItem`
      objects to store in an array
    - once the user has entered all items, print out all items grouped by
      category and alphabetized in each group

1. Build a command line Tic Tac Toe game.

    - the game board should be a multi-dimensional array of Strings
    - be sure the board displays the column letter and row number:

                A   B   C
            1  -O- --- ---
            2  --- -X- ---
            3  --- --- ---

    - the "O" in the example above is at 1a and the "X" is at 2B
    - the winning three in a row should match should be drawn with stars instead
      of dashes:

                A   B   C
            1  *O* *O* *O*
            2  --- -X- ---
            3  -X- --- ---

    - player one and player two should alternate turns
    - be sure to display who's turn it is and who won

# Java String Bonuses

### Date Format Converter Program

**Take in the following format:**

```MM/DD/YYYY```

**Output the following:**

```MonthName DD, YYYY```

**Example:**

input - ```12/01/1999```

output - ```December 12, 1999```

### Sentence Analyzer Program

Create sentence analyzer program that tells the user how many vowels and consonants were used.

**Example:**

input - ```"The hill are alive."```

output - ```5 vowels and 10 consonants```

### Command Line Calculator

The program should welcome the user, prompt them for a calculation,
and give the result. The user should be prompted after each result is
outputted if they want to enter another calculation. When they
say no, give them an exit message. Allow the user first to specify
how many operands they will enter. Do not worry about
input validation (assume user enters correct data type).

Example program:

```
WELCOME TO THE CALCULATOR APP!!! (program output)

Do you wish to enter a new calculation? (program output)
yes (user inputs this)

How many operands will you calculate? (program output)
2 (user inputs this)

Please enter a calculation: (program output)
2 + 2 (user enters this or something like this)
The output of 2 + 2 is 4. (program outputs this)

Do you wish to enter a new calculation? (program outputs this)
no (user enters this)

GOODBYE!!!

```
